# Implementation Planner Prompt — the planner

Use when dispatching the configured planner (`agents.planner`, default `general-purpose`) to produce `plan.md` in Stage 2. This prompt is two-mode — read the inputs to determine which applies. Pass the whole `## MODE A …` or `## MODE B …` block as the prompt body; the outer `~~~` fences below are documentation framing and are not part of the prompt itself.

---

## MODE A — Dispatch planning (no domain_plans provided)

Pass to the planner verbatim from `### Role` through end of `### Output`.

````
### Role
You are the planner. The spec is locked. The controller has NOT passed a `<domain_plans>` block — produce a dispatch plan only.

### Spec

<paste spec.md>

### Your task

1. Identify which specialists own which components. Use ONLY `agent_type` values from the roster below, which the controller filled in from the run's resolved specialists (a `--subagent` override, else `agents.specialists`, else a single `general-purpose` agent owning all code — in which case put everything under that one specialist). If a specialist's `<owns>` is the placeholder `code (planner allocates)`, **you own the allocation** — split the spec's components sensibly across the listed specialists:

<roster>
<!-- Controller: emit one line per resolved specialist as "  - <type>: <owns>", e.g.
  - api-developer: server APIs, services, persistence, auth
  - ui-developer: UI components, routing, client state
When the roster is the default, emit exactly:
  - general-purpose: all code
When it came from a bare multi-type --subagent override (no owns map), emit each as:
  - <type>: code (planner allocates)
and the planner assigns components across them in step 1.
-->
</roster>

2. Return a `<dispatch_plan>` block conforming to the schema in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/agentic-loop/references/plan-format.md` (Dispatch Plan Schema). Do NOT make any Agent calls yourself — the controller dispatches specialists. Use exactly this shape:

```
<dispatch_plan>
{
  "specialists": [
    {
      "agent_type": "<specialist-name>",
      "scope": "<one sentence: which components they own in this spec>",
      "components": ["<ComponentA>", "<ComponentB>"],
      "depends_on": []
    }
  ],
  "research_needed": [
    {
      "agent_type": "<analyst-name>",
      "question": "<what to investigate>",
      "feeds_into": ["<specialist-agent-type>"]
    }
  ],
  "shared_context": "<one paragraph framing all specialists need>"
}
</dispatch_plan>
```

3. Stop. Return ONLY the `<dispatch_plan>` block and nothing else. The controller will dispatch, collect domain plans, and call you again in Mode B.

### Output

A single `<dispatch_plan>...</dispatch_plan>` block containing valid JSON conforming to the Dispatch Plan Schema. No prose before or after.
````

## MODE B — Synthesis (domain_plans provided)

Pass to the planner verbatim from `### Role` through end of `### Output`.

```
### Role
You are the planner. The controller has collected domain plans from specialists and is asking you to synthesise a unified `plan.md`.

### Spec

<paste spec.md>

### Domain plans

<domain_plans>
<paste collected specialist domain plans here>
</domain_plans>

### Your task

1. Merge the domain plans into a single plan.md:
   - Header: Goal, Architecture, Tech stack, Issue #, Branch
   - File Structure: every file to create or modify, one-line responsibility each
   - Tasks: ordered so deps precede usages, cross-domain integration tasks after unit tasks
   - Each task follows the template in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/agentic-loop/references/plan-format.md` — exact file paths, **test signatures and assertion bullets** (NOT executable code), expected failure mode, minimal implementation surface, expected pass criteria, commit message

2. Run the Self-Review Checklist from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/agentic-loop/references/plan-format.md`:
   - Spec coverage: every goal and acceptance criterion maps to at least one task
   - No placeholders
   - Type/name consistency across tasks
   - Dependency order
   - Task granularity (2–5 min steps, one commit per task)
   - Test-first: every task's first step is a failing test (the implementer will write the test code)

3. Also produce tasks.json (see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/agentic-loop/references/plan-loop.md` schema) listing each task with id, domain, file_targets, deps.

### Output

Return the plan.md content inside `<plan>...</plan>` tags and the tasks.json inside `<tasks>...</tasks>` tags. No other prose.
```
